Problems
1.) make a simple webpage to accept the file.
via simple input type=file

2.) get the file to the server.
via body-parser

3.) read and write the file
done via the npm package xlsx

4.) converting the data into readable format
The problem was solved by parsing the data into the jSON and then using the convertToNewData that was defined by me to convert the data into the output format

5.) creating the new workbook and sending them to the browser that is exporting the data to another file.
Problem was solved by the FileSaver package

6.) now sending the data from the server to the client.
this was done via the res.download() option.
